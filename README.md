 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

#Your Prototype

##My prototype consists of a spin on roll a ball while incorporating some elements of applepicker. The basis of the game starts with a basketball and green cubes. The object of the game is to collect all the cubes and increase your score. The game gets difficult due to the cubes' constant randomization of position on the plane. I've taken the keyboard and ball movements from roll a ball and used the tree randomization from applepicker on the green cubes. This game is relatively simple but gets hard when you only can go up and down to try and search for the cubes. Have fun!
